# pic-a-word

It's an app that I'm working on currently. It's supposed to run along the lines of Snapchat, where a user can select a word, take a picture related to that word and send it to his/her friend to guess. The friends then sends a picture back for the user to guess.

I've also thought of giving an interactive UI and include a scoring system but I haven't started working on it yet so let's see how that goes.
